 Yaar .. politics and chutney are the same! Like brothers from the same mother. You take some cocunut, add some salt, green chilli, coriander, and some lallu-pappu spices, and blend them together to get a chutney. That's how easy it is to start a political party too .. find some lallu-pappus, add a few nautanki-wallas to it, create a flag, and thats it. Like chutneys, some parties survive for a day or two while some die and turn sour in a few hours. Join me as we look at the great Indian political chutney together. And while you are at it, please send some idli-dosas my way.
